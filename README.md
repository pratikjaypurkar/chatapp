# Chat App
Android chat app built in kotlin. 


### Problem Statement : 
Chat rooms have become a popular way to support a forum for n-way conversation or discussion among a set of people with interest in a common topic. Chat applications range from simple, text-based ones to entire virtual worlds with exotic graphics. In this project you are required to implement a simple text-based chat application.


### Problem Description:
Email, newsgroup and messaging applications provide means for communication among people but these are one-way mechanisms and they do not provide an easy way to carry on a real-time conversation or discussion with people involved. Chat room extends the one-way messaging concept to accommodate multi-way communication among a set of people.


### Proposed Solution : 
A chat app built in kotlin with implementation of android navigation components. The application is beneficial for the users as it is a compatible platform to stay connected to friends, families, colleagues, and many more. It connects people across the globe, and there is no time lag for sending the messages.
